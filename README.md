# Introduction

This is the toolset used at Softcatal√† to build the translation memories for all the projects that we know exist in Catalan language and have their translations available openly. You can see it on-line at <https://www.softcatala.org/recursos/memories/>

The toolset contains the following components with their own responsibility:

**Builder** (fetch and build memories)

- Download and unpack the files from source repositories
- Convert from the different translation formats (ts, strings, etc) to PO
- Create a translation memory for project in PO and TMX formats
- Produce a single translation memory file that contains all the projects

**Web**

- Provides an API that allow users download memories and search translations
- Provides an index-creator that creates a Whoosh index with all the strings than then the user can search using the web app
- Provides an download-creation that creates a zip file with all memories that the user can download

**Terminology** (terminology extraction)

- Analyzes the PO files and creates a report with the most common terminology across the projects

**Quality** (feedback on how to improve translations)

- Runs Pology and LanguageTool and generates HTML reports on translation quality

# Installation

## Setting up before execution

In order to download the translations of some of the projects you need to use the credentials for these systems, for example API keys.

*builder.py* expects the credentials to be defined at [cfg/credentials](./cfg/credentials) in the diferent YML files for each one of the sites that require crendentials.

If you use docker locally or in production, these credetials are configured in a enviorment variables than then are used to created the configuration YML files.

## Runing the builder code locally

This part focuses on helping run to the *builder* component locally if you want to quickly new projects configurations. For any other use case, we recommend using the Docker.

Debian:

```shell
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install python3-dev libhunspell-dev libyaml-dev gettext zip mercurial bzr ruby git curl wget g++ subversion bzip2 python2-dev -y
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transifex/cli/master/install.sh | bash && mv ./tx /usr/bin/
sudo gem install i18n-translators-tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

macOS:

```shell
brew install python3 breezy hunspell libyaml gettext zip mercurial ruby git curl wget gcc subversion bzip2
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transifex/cli/master/install.sh | bash
sudo gem install i18n-translators-tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For example, to download only the Abiword project:

```shell
cd src
./builder.py -p Abiword
```

## Running the system locally using Docker

This requires that you have *docker*, *docker-compose* and *make* installed in your system.

First download the data for the projects and generate the data quality reports:

```shell
make docker-builder-run
```

Downloading all the projects can take up to a day, which is not acceptable for a development cycle. In the [docker/local.yml](./docker/local.yml) the variable *DEV_SMALL_SET* forces to only download some projects. This small subset does not requiere any specific credentials to be defined to download them.

The output files are copied to *web-docker* local directory to make easy to for you explore the results.

To run the web app which provides the microservices for the web site:

```shell
make docker-webapp-run
```

To test it from the browser:
* List projects: http://localhost:8080/projects
