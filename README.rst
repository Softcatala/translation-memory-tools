============
Introduction
============

This is the toolset used at Softcatalà to build the translation memories for
all the projects that we know exist in Catalan language and have their
translations available openly.

The toolset contains the following components with their own responsibility:

Builder (fetch and build memories)

* Download and unpack the files from source repositories
* Convert from the different translation formats (ts, strings, etc) to PO
* Create a translation memory for project in PO and TMX formats
* Produce a single translation memory file that contains all the projects

Web

* Provides a web application and an API that allow users download memories and search translation
* Provides an index-creator that creates a Whoosh index with all the strings than then the user can search using the web app
* Provides an download-creation that creates a zip file with all memories that the user can download

Terminology (terminology extraction)

* Analyzes the PO files and creates a report with the most common terminology across the projects

Quality (feedback on how to improve translations)

* Runs Pology and LanguageTool and generates HTML reports on translation quality

Dependencies
============

* Python 3.4 or higher
* gettext
* Bazaar
* Subversion 1.7 or higher
* Git
* Ruby + (gem install i18n-translators-tools)
* Other requirements listed in requirements.txt


Installation
============

On Debian::

    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip gettext subversion git ruby bzr hunspell libhunspell-dev
    sudo gem install i18n-translators-tools
    cd translation-memory-tools/
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt


Setting up before execution
===========================

For Transifex's projects (all projects with type ``transifex`` at
``cfg/projects``), during the first execution you will need to setup
your Transifex credentials. After the first execution, the credentials will
be readed from the ``.transifexrc`` file. In order to download the
translations from a Transifex project, you need to be member of the project.

`Flask configuration`_

Logging
=======

After the execution a ``builder.log`` file is created with details for
execution.


Projects included in the translation memory
===========================================

The  ``cfg/projects`` directory contains the description of the projects that
are included in the translation memory.

If context is not provided (msgctxt), duplicated translations are not stored.
As result, the first occurrence of a string is added to the memory,
ignoring the rest. For this reason the projects with better translations
are first in the json file.

The supported file types are: ``PO``, ``TS`` and ``.strings`` files (transifex
repositories only).


Applications
============

Located at ``src`` subdirectory (scripts need to be run from that directory):

builder.py (main program)
   Builds the translation memory: downloads files, merge them and builds the
   final translation memory

compare-sets.py (for reporting proposes)
   Compares two sets of the PO files and counts the words
    
Located at ``web`` subdirectory:

search 
   Scripts to create the Whossh index and enable the web application
   
download-memories
   Generates the web page to download the memories
   
scripts
   All the automation scripts to build the system automatically nightly

Located at root directory:

unittests
   The unittest to check the functionality of different classes
   
integration-tests
   tests that check if what has been generated contains errors 


Commands
========

Merging the translation memory with a new file::

    msgmerge -N tm.po new-pofile.po > final-pofile.po

You can also use translate-toolkit's pretranslate tool
